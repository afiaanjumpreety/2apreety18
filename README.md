### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Afia**, a software engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh 🇧🇩 🛺

Passionate about building beautiful and user-friendly experiences, I currently work at [**@SELISE**](https://github.com/SELISEdigitalplatforms) where I've -

- Contributed to large-scale, high-impact products and services using microservices architecture and frameworks like Angular and React.  
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to manage workflows and timelines.  
- Maintained clear technical and business documentation for seamless project execution.


Outside the world of bugs and deadlines, you’ll probably find me binge-watching anime or giggling at a cheesy romcom. 
I’ve got more hobbies than tabs open in Chrome—baking, traveling, you name it.


Basically, a true jack of all fruits, master of none... but I like to think I’m part smoothie, part chaos in a coffee cup ☕️
