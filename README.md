### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Afia**, a software engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh 🇧🇩 🛺

Passionate about building beautiful and user-friendly experiences, I currently work at [**@SELISE**](https://github.com/SELISEdigitalplatforms) where I've contributed to large-scale, high-impact products and services using microservices architecture and frameworks like *Angular.js* and *Next.js*.

Outside of code, I'm a foodie who loves exploring diverse cuisines. I also enjoy unwinding with anime, k-dramas, and even creating lifestyle content on YouTube!
